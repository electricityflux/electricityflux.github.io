The sources of electricity in Great Britain (GB), referred to as the generation mix, have undergone significant changes over the past 50 years, with the 1980s and 1990s marking a shift from a predominantly coal-based power supply to one based on natural gas. Since the 2010s, a drive to renewable energy has occurred. Under the government's “Clean Power 2030 Action Plan”, it is anticipated that 95% of electricity demand will be from clean resources, reducing the overall carbon intensity from an average of 171 gCO2e/kWh in 2023 to 50 g/CO2e/kWh. To achieve this, the energy transition away from fossil fuel-based resources will need to accelerate even more quickly. The fuel mix of GB electricity is illustrated in Figure 1. Note that coal still holds a significant portion at 6% since this considers imports from European markets, which, unlike GB, still depend in part on coal for electricity.

Although the electricity utilised in homes and businesses is not provided by a specific generator, rather an “electricity pool” represented by a national average, as in Figure 1, suppliers do purchase specific units of energy from individual generators to then sell to consumers. This means that consumers with suppliers that only purchase renewable energy directly subsidise renewable energy infrastructure rather than fossil fuel-fired generation. Electricity suppliers are mandated under their licence conditions to publicly share where they purchase power from to sell to their customers under The Electricity (Fuel Mix Disclosure) Regulations 2005. For comparison purposes, this data has been collated in Table 1.

Many suppliers are leading the way in terms of emissions, surpassing the GB average in Figure 1. The first six depend on entirely on renewable energy. The first seven also solely use zero-emission resources. Scottish Power (SP) are the only supplier to offer a "green" and "non-green" option
