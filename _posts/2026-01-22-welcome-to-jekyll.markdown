The sources of electricity in Great Britain, known as the generation mix, has been transient for the past 50 years, with the 1980s and 90s seeing the switch from a predominantly coal based power supply to a natural gas based one. Under the governments “Clean Power 2030 Action Plan”, it is anticipated that 95% of electricity demand will be clean resources, reducing the overall carbon intensity from an average of 171 gCO2e/kWh in 2023 to 50 g/CO2e/kWh. To achieve this, the energy transition away from fossil fuel-based resources will need to move even quicker.

Although the electricity utilised in homes and businesses is not provided by a specific generator, rather an “electricity pool”, suppliers do purchase specific units of energy from individual generators to then sell to consumers. These suppliers are mandated to share where they purchase power from to sell to their customers under The Electricity (Fuel Mix Disclosure) Regulations 2005 to meet their Supply Licence conditions.
