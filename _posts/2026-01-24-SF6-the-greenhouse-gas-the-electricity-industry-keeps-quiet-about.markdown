SF6 is widely used in high voltage applications, either as an arc interrupting medium or an insulating gas. SF6 is extremely effective for this purpose, additionally being odourless, colourless, non-toxic and stable at extreme temperatures. Where SF6 is used as an arc interrupting medium, the gas is contained within a device, with the gas passing between circuit breaker contacts when they are opened. When used as an insulating medium, busbars are suspended within gas-filled cylindrical sections, which allow conductors to be housed much closer together. 

# The benefits of SF6
Before the adoption of SF6, air-insulated substations (AIS) were the prevailing installation, requiring large safety distances between pieces of equipment to prevent flashovers, subsequently making the overall substation footprint larger. The space required for gas-insulated substations (GIS), however, is typically 20% of the equivalent AIS substation. This factor is particularly significant for densely populated areas and city substations, making GIS an attractive alternative, requiring less capital for land purchasing. Although the cost of equipment is higher for GIS substations, they are shielded from the elements and generally placed indoors, reducing maintenance requirements and making them very reliable.

# The catch with SF6
SF6 has a huge global warming potential (GWP) of 23,500. GWP represents the capability of the gas to contain heat within the atmosphere relative to carbon dioxide. As such, CO2 has a GWP of 1, making SF6 23,500 times more potent. The GWP can be further compared to other greenhouse gases in Figure 2. Coupled with its widespread adoption, it is one of the most significant challenges in terms of sustainability for electrical transmission and distribution companies. It is anticipated that the UK government could take a similar approach to SF6 as the European Union, with potential bans on virgin gas from 2035 and a phase-out of >145 kV equipment from 2032, where they use F-gas with a GWP >10.

0.3 MtCO2e was emitted in the UK during 2023 due to SF6 emissions, equating to 13 t of SF6. Of these emissions, National Grid Electricity Transmission was responsible for 9276 kg, Scottish Power was responsible for 689 kg and Scottish and Southern Electricity was responsible for 406 kg. Overall emissions were 385 MtCO2e, making the contribution from SF6 0.01%.

# The future of insulating mediums
It is highly likely that a gas-insulation medium will be essential at certain substations due to space constraints. This means that solutions to the SF6 problem are limited to using less harmful alternative gases. Alternative gases are being introduced for new installations, which are significantly less harmful to the environment by companies such as GE Grid Solutions (g3 gas, which has a GWP of 235) and Hitachi (EconiQ gas, which has a GWP of 400). For existing substations, recycling SF6, rather than using virgin gas, is one way of minimising emissions. Naturally, fixing existing leaks and utilising capture devices will also minimise emissions. One of the most promising solutions for existing installations is retro-filling, whereby existing equipment has its SF6 gas removed, and a lower GWP replacement is used to take its place. This is estimated to be an order of magnitude less expensive than replacement with entirely new equipment utilising the low GWP gas.
