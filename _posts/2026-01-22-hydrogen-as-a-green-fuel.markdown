Hydrogen is a highly combustible element which produces no harmful emissions. It is the most abundant element in the universe; however, due to its extreme reactivity, it is often found in compounds and not immediately ready for use. Hydrogen is termed green when it is produced from renewable energy resources. In contrast, steam reforming may be considered grey if the waste carbon monoxide is released into the atmosphere or blue if it is captured and stored.
