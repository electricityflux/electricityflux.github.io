Hydrogen is a highly combustible element which produces no harmful emissions when used as a fuel. It is the most abundant element in the universe; however, due to its extreme reactivity, it is often found in compounds and not immediately ready for use. Hydrogen is termed green when it is produced from renewable energy resources by electrolysis. In contrast, hydrogen produced by steam methane reforming may be considered grey if the waste carbon monoxide is released into the atmosphere or blue if it is captured and stored. 

# Hydrogen opportunities and challenges

Green hydrogen could offer a low-carbon solution to the heating sector's current emissions in the UK. Hydrogen gas would be something consumers are more familiar with than heat pumps, given that 78.6% of households currently use mains gas for heating. A gradual transition can be carried out using hydrogen too, since it can be blended with methane. Maintaining the need for a gas distribution network for domestic consumers by switching from natural gas to hydrogen rather than solely utilising heat pumps would also secure existing jobs. 

## Hydrogen blends

Where hydrogen is blended with methane (the main component in natural gas), the extent of hydrogen blend in a combustion environment is limited, dependent on the technology used; while a boiler designed for 100% hydrogen combustion would work without issues, boilers designed to work with hydrogen blends typically have limitations for hydrogen content. These limitations are a result of the vastly different heating values associated with each compound, dictating specific design parameters for each type of boiler. Hydrogen also has a much lower energy per unit volume, so more gas needs to be transported and combusted to generate the same amount of heat as methane: this can become a challenge, whereby more energy is required to compress, store, and move the hydrogen.

## Hydrogen safety

Hydrogen is a very small element, meaning that it is more prone to leaks when compared with other hydrocarbon-based gases. Expensive leak-sensing equipment and modifications, due in part to leaks but also hydrogen embrittlement, to existing gas equipment are required where a replacement is to take place. The explosion risk for hydrogen is much more significant than natural gas, too, due to the prevalence of leaks and the higher flammability range from 4-75% compared to methane at around 5-15% by volume in air.
