The concept of global warming due to greenhouse gases, catalysed by the industrial world, is not a new one. It was first proposed in [1824 by Joseph Fourier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160932799012107?via%3Dihub), where he proposed a link between gases in the atmosphere and the heating of Earth. The greenhouse gas effect is characterised by the link between infrared radiation from the Sun reflected off the Earth's surface and the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere, which limits this radiation from escaping into space. One of the most prominent greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), a product of combustion reactions involving fossil fuels. The release of CO2 from fossil fuels is particularly problematic when compared to other fuels due to the time it takes to form, resulting in a net release of CO2.
