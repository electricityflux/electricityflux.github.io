The concept of utilising heat pumps for heating has been around for hundreds of years, and yet, despite this, domestic heating has been dominated by fossil fuels. Figure 1 illustrates the makeup of England’s central heating in terms of resources in 2025. Mains gas is the most favourable resource, accounting for 78.6% of properties. In 2021, domestic heating in the UK accounted for 18% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions. With the drive towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050, a drastic reduction in the utilisation of fossil fuels for domestic heating will be required. Although there is the possibility of utilisation of hydrogen gas as a fuel for heating, this comes with a unique set of challenges, and widespread adoption in the UK at present looks unlikely. This leaves the options of directly using renewable resources for heat or electrically generated heat.

# Heat pump operation and efficiency

Heat pumps operate by the same principles as an air-conditioner, only with a reversing valve, which allows the unit to transfer heat into a property in addition to out of a property. Energy is extracted either from the ground or air and moved into the property, utilising a refrigerant liquid to be dissipated as heat. Air-source heat pumps are like air-conditioning units in terms of features, whereas ground-source heat pumps require large boreholes or trenches to house pipes in addition to the heat pump unit.

Air-source heat pumps have a high efficiency of 300-400% compared to fossil fuel-fired appliances such as gas boilers, which have efficiencies of up to 94%. This means that for every 1 kWh of electricity, a heat pump produces 3-4 kWh of heat. Being three to four times more efficient than the gas counterparts may suggest they would be less expensive to run, though this is currently not the case due to a disparity in electricity and gas prices, with the current price cap indicating average costs of 28p/kWh for electricity and 6p/kWh. Without other smart devices such as solar or battery energy storage, the present high cost of electricity compared to gas makes the running costs of a heat pump marginal compared to gas boilers in most cases.

# Boiler Upgrade Scheme

The present government policy is most strongly supporting the installation of air-source heat pumps through the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS). The scheme offers £7,500 for households in England and Wales towards the installation of a heat pump. This scheme brings the costs of installing an air-source heat pump and gas closer, with a general figure being £11,000 for a heat pump and £4,000 for a gas boiler. The cost of a ground-source heat pump is typically significantly greater at £29,000, meaning that the scheme does little to compensate for this type.
