Great Britain (GB) is expected to heavily decarbonise its electricity supply by 2030, as set out by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) in the [Clean Power 2030](https://www.neso.energy/publications/clean-power-2030) report. It is anticipated that this decarbonisation will be driven by renewable inverter-based resources such as wind and solar power, displacing conventional thermal plant. One challenge associated with a low-carbon generation mix is the intermittency of supply and lack of monodirectional, predictable power flows at the transmission system level. The present transmission system was built to accommodate large fossil fuel-driven generation at specific locations; this topology does not align with a shift to predominantly offshore wind, and other generators remote from existing equipment. Where transmission capacity cannot be securely managed, generation is curtailed at a cost to the consumer. Curtailment can be for different reasons; however, the simplest and most common are thermal constraints, where the generation which should be producing power is told not to because the system around it is already at its current carrying capacity limit. The market works such that the units of electricity that would have been generated, were the generator not curtailed, are still paid for, even though they are not used. As demand and generation need to be met continuously, this power must be purchased from elsewhere, generally from dispatchable equipment such as combined cycle gas turbines. In effect, one unit of electricity is paid for twice, and the first unit is not utilised at all when curtailments are made. These costs are all subsidised by the consumer.

NESO currently [report](https://www.neso.energy/data-portal/constraint-breakdown) annual constraint costs approaching £2 billion, as displayed in Figure 1, and estimates in the [Clean Power 2030](https://www.neso.energy/publications/clean-power-2030) report that these costs may increase to £12.7 billion in 2030 without interventions. Constraints are managed at boundaries; an example is the Anglo-Scottish boundary, which accounts for a significant portion of the annual constraint costs. This boundary consists of two AC overhead line double circuits and the Western Link, which is an HVDC subsea interconnection which connects Wales and Scotland via the Irish Sea. The ratings of these circuits sum to make the total boundary transfer capacity. Increasing this rating will reduce the likelihood of constraints occurring at this boundary. Due to challenges in achieving consent for new overhead lines, transmission operators currently have [five HVDC interconnections](https://www.nationalgrid.com/the-great-grid-upgrade/where-its-happening) between England and Scotland, routed through the North Sea, in the development or construction phase.
